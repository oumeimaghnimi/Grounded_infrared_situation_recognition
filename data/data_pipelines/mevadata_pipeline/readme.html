The Multiview Extended Video with Activities (MEVA) dataset: 
       MEVA: A Large-Scale Multiview, Multimodal Video Dataset for Activity Detection 2021.
           https://mevadata.org/:
           The large-scale MEVA dataset is designed for activity detection in multi-camera environments

The ActEV (Activities in Extended Video) Sequestered Data Leaderboard is an ongoing ranking of software systems 
 that watch lengthy videos and detect activities of interest. 

ActEV Sequestered Data : https://actev.nist.gov/sdl20
        The data is from the Multiview Extended Video with Activities (MEVA) dataset 
         and the videos are from both EO (Electro-Optical) and IR (Infrared) sensors.
         Anyone can submit their system to NIST, which will then run the system on sequestered data,
         The sequestered data is from the MEVA dataset, which contains hours of videos,
         including indoor and outdoor scenes, night and day, crowds and individuals,
         and videos are from both EO (Electro-Optical) and IR (Infrared) sensors.
         Hours can go by with no activities, but then multiple activities happen simultaneously.
         The data is multi-camera, in that multiple cameras may be pointed at the same scene at the same time.
         There are also two separate leaderboards for EO and IR videos.
