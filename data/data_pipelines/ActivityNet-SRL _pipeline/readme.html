    ActivityNet SRL (ASRL) was created  from ActivityNet Captions (AC) and ActivityNet Entities (AE) datasets by following the underling steps:

 # https://github.com/TheShadow29/vognet-pytorch/:
 # ActivityNet SRL (ASRL) wasused in the context of Video Object Grounding (VOG): localization of  objects in a video referred in a query sentence description.
 # Semantic role of object relations are elevated via spatial and temporal concatenation of contrastive examples sampled from  ActivityNet-SRL (ASRL).
 
    1. Add semantic roles to captions in AC using SRL Labeling system from AllenAI: 
                   https://github.com/TheShadow29/vognet-pytorch/tree/master/dcode/sem_role_labeller.py
    1. Prepocess AE. In particular, resize all the proposals, ground-truth bounding boxes (this is required for SPAT/TEMP).
    1. Preprocess the features and choose only 5 groundtruths for GT5 setting.
    1. Obtain the bounding boxes and category names from AE for the relevant phrases.
    1. Filter out some verbs like "is", "are", "complete", "begin"
    1. Filter some SRL Arguments based on Frequency.
    1. Get Training/Validation/Test videos.
    1. Do Contrastive Sampling and store the dictionary files for easier sampling during training.

# Preparing Data

 download the data through   download_data.sh:

Optional: set the data folder.
```
cd $ROOT/data
bash download_data.sh all [data_folder]
```

After everything is downloaded successfully, the folder structure should look like:

```
data
|-- anet (530gb)
    |-- anet_detection_vg_fc6_feat_100rois.h5
    |-- anet_detection_vg_fc6_feat_100rois_resized.h5
    |-- anet_detection_vg_fc6_feat_gt5_rois.h5
    |-- fc6_feat_100rois
    |-- fc6_feat_5rois
    |-- rgb_motion_1d
|-- anet_cap_ent_files (31M)
    |-- anet_captions_all_splits.json
    |-- anet_ent_cls_bbox_trainval.json
    |-- csv_dir
	 |-- train.csv
	 |-- train_postproc.csv
	 |-- val.csv
	 |-- val_postproc.csv
    |-- dic_anet.json
|-- anet_srl_files (112M)
    |-- arg_vocab.pkl
    |-- trn_asrl_annots.csv
    |-- trn_srl_obj_to_index_dict.json
    |-- val_asrl_annots.csv
    |-- val_srl_obj_to_index_dict.json
```

It should ~530 gb of data !!

NOTE: Highly advisable to have the features in SSD; otherwise massive drop in speed!
