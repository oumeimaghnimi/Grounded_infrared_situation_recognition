AVA: A Video Dataset of Spatio-temporally Localized Atomic Visual Actions 2018: 
AVA-Kinetics Dataset:AVA-Kinetics, our latest release, is a crossover between the AVA Actions and Kinetics datasets. 
In order to provide localized action labels on a wider variety of visual scenes, we've provided AVA action labels on videos from Kinetics-700,
nearly doubling the number of total annotations, and increasing the number of unique videos by over 500x. We hope this will expand the generalizability of localized action models, and open the door to new approaches in multi-task learning.

AVA-Kinetics is described in detail in  paper: The AVA-Kinetics Localized Human Actions Video Dataset 2020.

AVA-Kinetics is now available for download. It was the basis of a challenge in partnership with the ActivityNet workshops at CVPR 2020-2022.
