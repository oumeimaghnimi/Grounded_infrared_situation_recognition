Actions can be represented using various data modalities:
          RGB, skeleton, depth, infrared, point cloud,event stream, audio, acceleration, radar, and WiFi signal,
          which encode different sources of useful yet distinct information and have various advantages depending on the application scenarios.
          
 Consequently, we will attempt to investigate different types of approaches for action reconition using various modalities.


Preprocessing multi-modal data:
   1-Thermal Infrared Object Tracking Benchmark:LSOTB: infrared
   2-NTU RGB+D 60âˆ•120: RGB, skeleton, depth, infrared
   3-Kinetics 400/600/700(Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset): skeleton with openpose, RGB
   4-Hand Gesture Recognition datasets: infrared, skeleton
